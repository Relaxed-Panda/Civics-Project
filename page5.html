            <h4>What is the Executive Branch? What does it do?</h4>
            <p>The Executive Branch is one of the 3 branches of congress that houses the President, Vice President, and 
            and the departments. The Executive Branch controls the departments, gives suggestions to congress, meets with diplomats,
            ensures law are carried out, make treaties (with the senate), leads the armed forces, and appoints members for the supreme court.</p>
            <h4>Requirements for President</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>must serve for 4 years</li>
              <li>elected using the Electoral College System </li>
              <li>Must be at least 35 years old</li>
              <li>Must be born in the U.S.</li>
              <li>Must give a yearly speech to the nation</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Departments and Impeachments</h4>
            <p>
              The president is in charge of the many departments that oversee the government like the CIA and Department of Defense. 
              Each department has a leader in which advices the president in pressing matters. Those leaders of each department forms the 
              U.S. Presidential Cabinet. This system is known as a bureaucracy. The president is in charge and is the boss of people who are 
              in charge of the other departments.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the president or any other civil officer of the U.S. is charged with a serious crime (Like treason), they are impeached. 
              Unlike popular belief, impeachment is not equivilent to removal of office. Impeachment is the process of charging someone that holds
              public office. Impeachment, under the constitution, may lead to the resignation or removal of office of the individual who has commited a misconduct. This
              allows the President to be charged with crimes and asserts that no one (not even the president) is above the law.
