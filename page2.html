            <h2>GONZO ACCUSED OF THE MURDER OF ROCKY</h2>

              The murder that took the life of Rocky the Ram has sparked controversy as 
              Gonzo is now accused of the murder. The previous suspect, Munson, was deemed too slow
              as he is a turtle. Gonzo, like Munson, has been trying to claim the spot of the Mascot
              of Rocky Run after failing to become President. If found guilty, he will be sentenced to 
              life in prison for murder of the 1st degree. The court case starts on April 9th and experts 
              say, "It is likely that Gonzo is not the murderer, but he is the closest suspect we got."
