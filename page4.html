            <h4>What is the Legislative Branch? What does it do?</h4>
            <p>The Legislative Branch is one of the 3 branches of the U.S. government. The Legislative
            government is important as it is responsible for establishing post offices, to createing courts, to regulating
commerce (business) between the states, to declaring war, and to raising money through taxes. This branch allows states to equaly represent themselves and discuss matters with the nation. </p>
        <h4>The Bill to Law Process</h4>
<p>
  The Bill to Law Process is a process that allows an idea to become a law. To start this process, a person must have an
  idea that is sponsered by a congressman to make it a bill. Then, the bill is put through committees that get rid of unnecessary bills.
  There are many committees depending on the situation. For example, a bill to regulate ai would be reviewed by The U.S. Science, Space, and Technology committee
  rather than the budget committee. After that, the bill is debated and reviewed by both chambers on congress. In order to pass, the bill must be favored by
  majority. Then, the bill must be signed by the president. However, if the president wants revisions or does not sign the bill, the bill
  must be changed and debated again by congress. Congress can also pass a vetoed bill if 2/3 of both chambers of congress agrees. Finally, the bill is reviewed
  by the Supreme Court to see if the bill is unconstitutional. The Bill to Law Process is a long one and most bills don't even make it to congress.
  By letting the people decide the laws and regulations, the U.S. is truely by the people, for the people.

<h4>Requirements to become a member of congress</h4>
<p>To become a member of the House of Representatives, one must:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Be 25 years or older</li>
  <li>Have been a citizen of the U.S. for at least 7 years</li>
  <li>Be elected by the people</li>
  <li>Live in the state they choose to represent</li>
  <li>Serve for 2 years</li>
</ol>
<p>To become a member of the Senate, one must:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Have been a citizen of the U.S. for at least 9 years</li>
  <li>Be elected by the people</li>
  <li>Live in the state they choose to represent</li>
  <li>serve for 6 years</li>
</ol>
<h4>Differences and Similarities between the Senate and the House</h4>
<p>
    The Senate and the House of Representatives (although having almost identical roles), have many differences and similarities. They both have members that
  represent their states, however in the senate, they have 2 members from each state, whereas the number of representatives depends on the population size on the house 
  side. Another worthy difference is the leader of each chamber. In the House of Representatives, the elected leader is a member of the house known as, "The Speaker of the House",however
  in the senate side, the Vice President is the leader. However dispite many differences, there are also many simularities like congress must meet every year at least once, not being delayed while traveling to and from Congress,
  not being able to hold any other office in the government while in the Congress, and preventing passing laws that make something illegal in the past, holding someone jail without reason, passing laws that give one state preferance,
  etc. These differences and simularities makes each side more unique and helps run our government in their own ways.
