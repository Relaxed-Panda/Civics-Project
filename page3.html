            <h4>What is the U.S. Constitution?</h4>
            <p>The U.S. Constitution is a document that the founding fathers of the United States of America made after
            winning the American Revolution. This document is the supreme law of the land. The Constitution balences the branches
            of the government, establishes the government system, and explains the purpose of the government: to serve
            its people. So you see, this document is very important.</p>
        <h4>Preamble-the Overview</h4>
<p>The preamble of the constitution is the introduction to the constitution and shows the purpose of 
   the government, which is to serve its people. The preamble also sets the stage for the articles
   and amendments shown on the next pages.
</p>
<br>
<p>"We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice,
insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the 
Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution 
for the United States of America."</p>
