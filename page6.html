            <h4>What is the Judicial Branch? What does it do?</h4>
            <p>The Judicial Branch is one of the 3 branches of congress that has the Supreme Court and the Justices (Judges) . The Judicial Branch 
            ensures that laws are constitutional and reviews court cases that change history. The Judicial Branch is important because without it, 
            many loop holes and inconsistencies will begin to show and affect people.
            </p>
            <h4>What types of cases does the Supreme Court choose?</h4>
            <p>
              Unfortunatly for people, the Supreme Court only reviews influential cases that affect the whole nation. Some examples include: 
              Brown V.S. Board of Education, Plessy vs Ferguson, etc. This means that out of the usual 7000-8000 cases, the justices only evaluate
              100-200 cases on average.
            </p>
            <h4>Treason</h4>
            <p>Treason is the only crime listed in the constitution. It's a criminal crime that ensures trial by jury like every other criminal court case.
            However, unlike any other crime, treason is expressed in the constitution because the individual who commits it, has betrayed their country and his/her allegiance.</p>
            <p>Requirements for Supreme Court Justices:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Must serve for life or retirement</li>
              <li>Appointed by the president</li>
              <li>There are 9 Supreme Court Justices</li>
            </ol>
