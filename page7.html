          <p>This part will put amendments into groups and explain what each amendment does.</p>
            <h4>The Bill of Rights</h4>
            <p>The Bill of Rights is a set of diverse rights that are ensured by the U.S. Constitution. The rights include unalienable rights, 
            the right to own a gun, The right to not house a soldier,(remember what led to Boston Massacre), search and seizure, rights to life, liberty, property and no double
            jeopardy, right to a quick trial, protection from excessive bail, etc. The rights not lited here are also given to the people or dictated by states. The bill of rights are
            important for the constitution due to giveing people power which contrasts to a monarchy or an authoritarian government.</p
            <h4>Voting Amendments</h4>
            <p>The Voting Amendments are used to catagorize all the Amendments that have to do with voting for office. These Amendments are the 12, 17th, 20th, and 22nd-26th Amendment.
            These Amendments are the main amendments that make requirements for voting like being 18+ to vote (26th) and also things like seperate ballots for the President and Vice-Presidential races.</p>
            <h4>Equality Amendments</h4>
            <p>The Equality Amendments are used for amendments that give people more equality. Some examples include: The abolishment of slaves (13), women's rights to vote (19), and equal 
            protection under the law (14). These amendments are important because it helped people realize that other people mattered even though they weren't the same as you.
            </p>
            <h4>Alcohol Amendments</h4>
            <p>The 18th Amendment made alcohol illegal to consume and created speakeasies (private bars that were hidden from the cops). Although it was a great idea to ban alcohol, it 
            ultimatly failed due to unforced laws and resurgance in gang activity. Finally in 1933, the 21st amendment was ratified and repealed the 18th amendment ending the prohibition era. </p>
